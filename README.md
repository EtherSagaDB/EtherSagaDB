# EtherSagaDB
Just a website to host a simple database in the form of a basic website from an old chinese MMO I used to play.

# Why are you doing this?
The site that we normally use as a database for information about the game is always going down and it seems like this time it is down for good. My goal is to keep information about this game alive in the hopes that someone will create a great private server for people to enjoy the game I once loved before it disappears into obscurity.
